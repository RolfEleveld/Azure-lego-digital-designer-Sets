#Azure Stoage
created on a 16x16 base plate and standing one base brick high to allow for connections such as Network and grouping items together with pins, such as storage array or geo-clusters.

##fairly sizable
The cylinder is the largets cylinder that still is round in LEGO. I took a colorful inside brick to support the glow that is also found on teh Azure calendar.
I put a lamp shade inside as I wanted to put light inside, which makes a nice glow in the same color possible... I did not yet find the 2x2 light brick in designer...
